Diffusion of rod-like nanoparticles in non-adhesive and adhesive porous polymeric gels

Wang, Jiuling, et al. "Diffusion of rod-like nanoparticles in non-adhesive and adhesive porous polymeric gels." Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids 112 (2018): 431-457.

I provided a code to compute and integrate : N = ¯N 1 + ¯N 2 + ¯N 3 + ¯N 4 ( Wang's Eq 7)
Please email me for the code
